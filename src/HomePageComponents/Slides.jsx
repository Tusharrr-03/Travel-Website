                  <h3>Historical Forts</h3>
                  <p>The forts are usually the most sought-after attraction for any city. Apart from being the most beautiful part of the city the forts also speak volumes about the culture and history of the city. It stands tall with pride hiding in its walls the stories of wars and cultures. Each room of the fort has a different story to tell. The victories and defeats of the dynasties are all within the forts. Rajasthan is known for its extravagant culture and history. The maharajas and maharanis have a great impact on each of our history textbooks and so do their huge residences. The Bhatner Fort located in Hanumangarh, Rajasthan is also known to be one of the oldest forts in India. Anupgarh Fort, Bala Qila, Kumbalgarh Fort, Garh Palace, Jaisalmer Fort, and Jaigarh Fort are just some examples of how vast the rich cultural heritage of Rajasthan is.</p>

                  <h3>Royal Places</h3>
                  <p>The lesser-known fact about palaces is their vastness of culture. We often tend to associate the term palace word royalty but we usually fail to go deep into the humongous stories of the very place where the royalties reside. The palace is itself an attractive spot to spend time and learn about the history related to the families with deeper secrets of their reign. The state of Rajasthan welcomes you to unearth the royal families with their exquisite residences. City palaces of Karauli, Dholpur, and Jaipur share the same name but have hundreds of different stories to tell. From the boundaries surrounded by once river meant to protect the families from wars to the room where the Ranis used to leisurely play along with their maids to the huge rooms where the Rajas used to listen to the problems of their kingdom.</p>

                  <p>The Pushkar Fair is organized yearly in the Kartik month. The Karni Mata Fair is held twice a year during Navratras.
